# experimentScripts
These scripts were used in a study to convert a Qualtrics site into a functional social media site.

You can use these scripts, but I fully admit they are not well-documented and lacking resources (such as images used). I am having to withold the images and things used until the piece is out of review as they may make the submission identifiable. I hope to update this once the relevant journal article finds a home.
